Another Webpack React Kit.

Why
-------------

Because there are many React starter kits but some are so specific and difficult to take in hands.

Idea was to take in hands following stack :

* [ES6](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es6/) : and you will learn React with awesome ECM6 features.
* [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) : amazing bundler, still to learn so much about it.
* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) : choosed because I love idea of Virtual DOM.
* [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html) : flux and used implementation is [Alt](http://alt.js.org/)
* [Immutable](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) : Immutable everywhere.
* [EsLint](http://eslint.org/): JS and JSX syntax validator.
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/): Version 4.
* [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/): Testing.

For a simple website with no server side it is really fine.

For a more complex website, an Express server is used but work is not finished.

- Server side React rendering is ready and done through [React-Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
- Flux on server side has begin thanks to [Iso](https://github.com/goatslacker/iso/) and Alt feature to bootstrap your app with data.
- Some API server routes are just given as example.
- You can debug it on server side thanks to sourcemaps.
- *NEW FEATURE* : hot reloading of you code on server side too (node), it will patch silently without restarting your node server.

On both client/server [Fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch) request handler is used (for example on server side)

Hope you will enjoy.

CODE, DEBUG in an isomorphic JS way !

Demo
-------------

https://react-web.herokuapp.com/

Try reload page, put wrong path, snapshot todo list...play, I will improve it later to show how it works.

How to use it
-------------

*DEV ONLY CLIENT*

Webpack with hot changes loading but no own server, enough for a single presentation page app by instance. Port: 8080

See changes at [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)

```bash
npm run dev
```

*DEV ONLY CLIENT/SERVER*

Let's use your own NodeJS server.

Start webpack in background with *hot changes loading* and *debug* in both client/server sides.

```bash
npm run dev-server-client
```

*THEN* when bundle is generated in build folder, start your node server (express), launched in ES6 thanks to Babel.

```bash
npm run dev-server
```

or with debug nodejs mode :

```bash
node-inspector &
```

```bash
npm run dev-server-debug
```

Go to inspector (because of break mode) [http://localhost:8080/?ws=localhost:8080&port=5858](http://localhost:8080/?ws=localhost:8080&port=5858)

See changes at [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000)

*PRODUCTION*

Build production bundle both client and server.
```
npm run build
```

Run production client/server React/Express website.

```
npm run start
```

See it at [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000)

FOCUS
-------------

Thanks to [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet), now you will be able to enhance head dom part with one json configuration [file](https://github.com/darul75/web-react/blob/master/assets/config.json).

```json
{
  "title": "web-react",
  "meta":[
    {
      "name": "description",
      "content": "Webpack Node React Starter Kit"
    },
    {
      "name": "viewport",
      "content": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"
    }
  ],
  "link": [
    {
      "rel": "shortcut icon",
      "href": "/favicon.ico",

    },
    {
      "rel": "icon",

TODO
-------------

- [x] Update React/React routet version and other libraries if needed
- [ ] Look at webpack node middleware for HMR
- [ ] Now that io.js and node merged again, see for ES6/ES7 compliance and refactoring
- [ ] More example of routing, fetching.
- [ ] More tests
- [ ] Change flux implementation => redux ?
